# MELFA ROS2 iQ Platform
_**Technology Convergence of Open Source and Factory Automation**_


## 1. Overview

This package connects **MELFA ROS 2**  with other Mitsubishi Electric's FA products via [Mitsubishi Electric‚Äôs iQ Platform](https://www.mitsubishielectric.com/fa/sols/efactory/iq/index.html), enabling both flexible development and industrial-level control.

We demonstrate:

- Controlling Robot Controller's GPIOs via Mitsubishi Electric HMI (Human Machine Interfaces)
- Reflecting ROS 2 messages on HMI (lights, indicators)

## 2. Why Use This Package?

-  ROS 2 is powerful but lacks hard real-time guarantees and safety certification
-  Mitsubishi Electric PLCs and HMIs offer industrial-grade reliability and control
-  This package merges both worlds for safer, flexible, and scalable robot control
